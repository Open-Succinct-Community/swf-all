# Quick Start 
## Developing your first Succinct Application 
This section we will see how to write an application to store personal contacts. We will use this example to learn various aspects of developing applications on Succinct Framework. We have intentionally not  taken the conventional Hello World as it is not a representative application of any real world application. 

### Prerequisites
* Java >= 1.8 (We recommend use  of jdk LTS 17)
* maven >= 3.8.3
